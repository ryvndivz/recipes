Ingredients
½ cup organic virgin coconut oil
½ cup natural peanut butter or almond butter (with less than 5 grams of sugar)
2-3 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2-4 tablespoons Agave (or sweetened to taste)*note* If using these in a Keto
diet you'll need to go with a keto-friendly sweetener like Stevia. Just sweeten
to taste)
Splash of vanilla extract (optional)
Instructions
In a large skillet over low heat melt coconut oil and peanut butter.
Stir in cocoa powder.
Stir in agave.
Remove from heat and add vanilla extract if using.
Pour into a spouted cup to make pouring easier.
Pour mixture into silicone candy molds. (my mold holds over ½ tablespoon)
Freeze or refrigerate until set.
Remove from molds and store in the fridge in an air tight container.
Eat one fat bomb to curb the appetite or satisfy your sweet tooth.
Notes
I like to use a mixture of almond butter and peanut butter. Use a low sugar
variety.
